##linux_useradd_expiry (KodeKloud)

A developer mark has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for mark. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named mark on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

-> sudo adduser mark 
-> sudo chage -E 2021-03-28 mark --TO ADD EXPIRY DATE TO LINUX USER 
-> sudo chage -l mark --TO SEE ALL INFORMATION FOR LINUX USER

NOTE:
(chage -d 2018-02-11 mark) --To set the date or number of days when the password was last changed, use the -d flag as follows
(chage -W 10 mark) --Then, the -W option allows you to set the number of days of warning before a password change is required. Considering the command below, the user mark will be warned 10 days prior to his password expiring.
(man chage) --MANUAL
